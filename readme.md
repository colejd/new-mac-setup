This repo contains a shell script and resources to set up a new computer the way I like it.

## Usage
Pull this repo into your home directory and name the directory "setup", then run setup.sh.
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/colejd/new-mac-setup.git setup
cd setup
sh ./setup.sh
```

You can also run `setup-terminal.sh` to auto-install dependencies that I use for the terminal. This one involves a bunch of network requests, so be careful that they're all still correct when you run this. You may not want to do this. **I assume no liability for any damage these scripts may cause to your machine!**
